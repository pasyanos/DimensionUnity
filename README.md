# DimensionUnity
Pipeline for 3D models/animations to 2D sprite sheets in Unity Engine.

Originally my capstone project for my MS in Computer Science. Currently working on documentation and some code updates.

Planned updates:
- Documentation
- Making an exportable Unity package.
- Allowing for more flexible keyframe timing.
- UI updates.
- QOL utility functions, including allowing playback of animations before exporting sprite sheets
